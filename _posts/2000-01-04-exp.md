## Improved Prototypes Selection
![ex_screenshot](./img/kernel.png)

Prototypes extracted by the MMD method based on the Gram kernel and the rbf kernel in Uwave dataset. The first column shows the prototypes (representative samples) of selected groups and remaining columns show which sub-sequences belong to given prototype groups. We observe that the prototypes selected from the Gram kernel reflect the shapes of sub-sequences better since the Gram kernel is robust on the temporal shift of the pattern. Note that Group 2 and its temporally shifted one (Group 7) are extracted by the rbf kernel based method as distinct ones.

## Value-LRP

 (a) Data-LRP plot; blue lines are selected patterns and red points are LRP scores, Value-LRP plot; x-axis is the value and y-axis is the attribution value, LRP score. Detailed descriptions and explanations are provided in Section \ref{sec:value-LRP}.(b) Prototypes of some selected groups.
